# docker-stacks
Stacks of ready-to-run applications in Docker.

## Quick Start

If you're familiar with Docker, have it configured, and know exactly what you'd like to run, this one-liner should work in most cases:

```
docker run -d -P buckarooch/<your desired stack>
```

## Getting Started

If this is your first time using Docker or any of the Jupyter projects, do the following to get started.

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) on your host of choice.
2. Open the README in one of the folders in this git repository.
3. Follow the README for that stack.
